### Hello folks ! <img src="https://github.com/kky-fury/kky-fury/blob/main/wave.gif" width="30">

My name is Mohak Chadha, I am currently a final-year PhD candidate at the [Chair of Computer Architecture and Parallel Systems](https://www.ce.cit.tum.de/caps/startseite/) at the Technical University of Munich. My research interests are in the domain of cloud computing, particularly focusing on serverless computing, systems for machine learning, and high performance computing. During my PhD, I have worked on scalable serverless Federated Learning: [FedLess](https://github.com/Serverless-Federated-Learning/FedLess), lightweight isolation of HPC applications: [MPIWasm](https://github.com/kky-fury/MPIWasm), and carbon-aware scheduling of serverless functions: [GreenCourier](https://github.com/kky-fury/carbon-sched), amongst other projects. Moreover, I have had the privilege of presenting my work at various developer conferences which you can find [here](https://kky-fury.github.io/techtalks/).
